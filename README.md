#### About this repository

This repository serves as the supporting information for my thesis.

###### Figure 2B

Heatmaps in pdf and svg format that demonstrate the Pearson correlation among all surviving libraries for mouse and human.

Tables in tsv format that record the number of overlapping peaks among all libraries for mouse and human. They were used for the calculation of Jaccard index.

###### Figure 2C

Heatmaps in pdf and svg format that show the enrichment of Homer known motifs in the merged libraries.

Tables in tsv format that record the P values for known motif enrichment.

###### Figure 3A

Heatmaps in pdf format that show the similarity among motifs for the four transcription factor family.

###### Figure 4

[human_inferred_pairs.pdf](https://github.com/MASSIVEkinetic/2019-thesis/blob/master/Figure_4/human_inferred_pairs.pdf "human_inferred_pairs.pdf") shows all inferred transcription factor pairs in human cell lines and cell types.

[mouse_inferred_pairs.pdf](https://github.com/MASSIVEkinetic/2019-thesis/blob/master/Figure_4/mouse_inferred_pairs.pdf "mouse_inferred_pairs.pdf") shows all inferred transcription factor pairs in mouse cell lines and cell types.

[human_outlier_deleted.pdf](https://github.com/MASSIVEkinetic/2019-thesis/blob/master/Figure_4/human_outlier_deleted.pdf "human_outlier_deleted.pdf") is the heatmap showing inferred pairs after what we thought to be outliers were deleted.

###### Figure 7A

Heatmap showing the Pearson correlation between CO, OC, and PO (PA) peaks and ChIP peaks containing Sox/POU pairs of interest. For ChIP peaks containing Sox/POU pairs (or libraries of hits), a typical name is SOX2_iPSC_POUAf-1-SOXBr, which means that POUAf-1-SOXBr is searched in an iPSC Sox2 library to find peaks containing this pair.

###### Figure 7C

Heatmaps showing the enrichment of all inferred Fox/POU, Fox/Sox, Pax/POU, and Pax/Sox pairs in CO, OC, and PO (PA) peaks. For Sox/POU pairs, only those that are enriched in both POU and Sox libraries for 10 MEF, ES, and iPS cell lines for mouse are used in this assessment.
